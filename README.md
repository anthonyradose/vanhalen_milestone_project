This project is a demonstration of my design and web development skills. I created a website for Van Halen as if it were late 1983, showcasing what the band's website might have looked like during that time.

The website has different sections: 

- The homepage displays the band's logo and their "new" single, which is a Youtube video of their song "Jump" that would have been released at the time.
- The tour section provides information about the band's "upcoming" world tour starting in 1984.
- The media section includes photos and videos of the band.
- The music section displays the album covers and includes embedded Spotify playlists.
- The merch section which fictionalizes some items to buy.
- The news section announces the "upcoming" release of their 1984 album.
- The contact section has three fictional forms: one for fan mail, one to purchase tickets for the upcoming tour, and the last one to pre-order the album.

Thanks for checking this out! This is my love letter to the raddest band to ever exist!

1. User Experience

1.1 What this project is and why -
This project is a demonstration of design and web development skills, presented as if it were a Van Halen website in late 1983, with the internet in its current form. The purpose of the project is to provide an immersive experience for fans of the band, as well as showcase the capabilities of the developer.

1.2 Target audience -
The target audience for this project is Van Halen fans, as well as anyone interested in web design and development.

1.3 User Stories -
As a Van Halen fan, I want to be able to listen to their music and learn more about the band's history.
As a user interested in web design and development, I want to see an example of how a website can be designed and developed to capture a specific aesthetic and time period.

1.4 What to expect -
Fans of Van Halen can expect an immersive experience that captures the spirit of the band in the late 1983, just before their mammoth album 1984 was released the following January. The website includes information about the band's world tour at that time, photos and videos of the band, embedded Spotify playlists, and a fictional merch section with t-shirts, posters, and hats. Additionally, fans can interact with the band through a fictional contact section, which includes forms for fan mail, ticket purchases, and album pre-orders.

1.5 Web Design -
The website features a design that is inspired by the aesthetic of the 1980s, with a color scheme that is reminiscent of the band's aesthetic. The layout is clean and easy to navigate, with a simple menu at the top of the page and clear sections for different types of content.

Note: Wireframes for this project are not currently available. I am working on creating them and will update the repository as soon as they are ready

1.6 Website Walkthrough -
Upon visiting the website, users are greeted with the band's logo and a Youtube video of their new single "Jump", which would have been released at the time. From there, users can navigate to different sections of the website using the menu at the top of the page. The Tour section displays information about the band's 'upcoming world tour' starting in 1984, including the dates and locations of the concerts. The Media section includes photos and videos of the band, showcasing their performance and style. The Music section displays the album covers and includes embedded Spotify playlists, allowing users to listen to the band's music as they browse the website. The Merch section features fictional items for users to buy, such as t-shirts, posters, and hats, all designed with the iconic Van Halen logo. The News section announces the 'upcoming' release of their 1984 album, keeping users up-to-date with the latest news about the band. Finally, the Contact section provides three fictional forms, one for fan mail, one to purchase tickets for the upcoming tour, and the last one to pre-order the album.

# Manual Device Testing/Responsive Design Testing

I have carried out manual testing on the following devices to test responsiveness, all links and videos and music tracks and features all worked correctly. The devices were tested on the following:

* Galaxy S10
* Ipad
* Tablets
* Laptops

## Manual Testing

Please note that this project is still a work in progress and manual testing has not yet been documented

# 6.Deployment

I deployed the website initially using Gitpod and later continued development using Visual Studio Code (VSCode). Here are the steps I followed:

**With Gitpod:**
1. Created a new repository on GitHub by logging into my GitHub account and selecting "New" repository.

2. Named the repository "vanhalen_milestone_project" and added a brief description.

3. Selected the desired options for repository visibility (public or private) and created the repository.

4. Once the repository was created, I navigated to the repository page on GitHub.

5. Clicked on the "Gitpod" button on the GitHub repository page.

6. This action automatically launched the Gitpod IDE, providing me with an online development environment preconfigured with the repository.

7. Developed and tested the website within the Gitpod workspace, using the Gitpod IDE features and tools.

8. Previewed the website by launching a local server within Gitpod.

9. Accessed the live preview of the website in the browser within the Gitpod workspace.

10. The site was fully deployed and accessible for testing and demonstration purposes within Gitpod.



**With VScode:**

1. Cloned the Git repository to a local directory using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/myusername/vanhalen_milestone_project.git

2. Opened the project folder in Visual Studio Code (VSCode) by selecting "Open Folder" from the File menu and choosing the appropriate directory.

3. Made any necessary changes and committed them to the Git repository using the following commands:
git add .
git commit -m "Added x feature to..."
Pushed the changes to the GitHub repository:
git push origin main

4. Opened any of the HTML files (e.g., index.html, tour.html, media.html, etc.) in a web browser of my choice directly from the local project directory.
