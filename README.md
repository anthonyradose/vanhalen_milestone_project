Welcome to Van Halen '83, a virtual journey back to 1983 where the legendary rock band Van Halen reigns supreme. Step into the world of roaring guitar solos, electrifying stage performances, and timeless hits that continue to resonate with fans today.

Imagine a time when the internet, as we know it today, existed alongside the thrilling energy of Van Halen's heyday. The website takes you on a nostalgic ride, blending the magic of the band with the possibilities of the digital era.

This website transports you back to the thrilling era of Van Halen in 1983, specifically late 1983 when the band is hot off the tails from their number 1 single 'Jump' and is about to release their much-anticipated album '1984' in the new year. 

Thanks for checking this out! This is my love letter to the raddest band to ever exist!

- Wire frames

### 1. Purpose of Project -    
The aim is to reimagine what it would be like if today's internet existed during 1983.
In addition to providing information about the band, their music, and their iconic world tour of 1984, there's a fictional merch section, a ticket-buying experience for the tour, and even a platform to send fan mail and pre-order their upcoming album, '1984'. While these features are not functional in reality, they simulate the experience of engaging with Van Halen's world as if you were a passionate fan in 1983. Through these interactive elements, the aim is to capture the nostalgia and excitement surrounding Van Halen at the height of their fame and provide a portal to that era.

### 2. User Stories -
1. As a user, I want to know about the band and their history. I expect to find information about the band's formation and significant milestones in their career. Additionally, I would like to learn about the individual band members and their contributions to Van Halen's success.
2. As a user, I want to explore Van Halen's music and discography. I expect to find a well-organised and easily accessible discography section that lists their albums, along with album cover art and track listings. It would be great to have the ability to listen to song previews or access full tracks through embedded Spotify playlists, allowing me to immerse myself in Van Halen's iconic sound.
3. As a user, I want to connect with Van Halen's online presence. I look forward to finding links to their official social media profiles, such as Facebook and Instagram. This would enable me to stay up-to-date with the band's latest news, announcements, and engage with other fans in the community.
4. As a user, I want to dive deeper into Van Halen's visual content. I expect to find a collection of music videos, pictures of the band, and interviews. These multimedia elements will provide me with a visual and auditory experience, allowing me to further appreciate Van Halen's artistry and stage presence.
5. As a user, I want to feel immersed in the Van Halen experience of the late 1983 era. I expect the website's design, colour scheme, and layout to reflect the aesthetic and vibe of that time period, transporting me back to the excitement and energy of Van Halen's heyday.
6. As a user, I want to explore the tour section that will list their ‘upcoming’ tour in 1984. I expect to find information about the tour dates, venues, and ticket purchasing options. Although the tour is fictional, it would be engaging to experience the anticipation and excitement surrounding a major concert tour.
7. As a user, I want to immerse myself in the fictional merch section and browse through the available merchandise inspired by Van Halen's iconic branding. It would be great to have an option to "purchase" these fictional items for added engagement.
8. As a user, I want to feel connected to Van Halen by utilizing the fictional contact section. I expect to find a fan mail form where I can express my admiration for the band, a ticket purchase form to simulate buying tickets for their upcoming tour, and a pre-order form for their anticipated 1984 album. Although these forms are fictional, they can provide a fun and interactive way to engage with the band's imagined activities.

### 3. Web Design -

The website features a design that is inspired by the aesthetic of the 1980s, with a color scheme that is reminiscent of the band's aesthetic. The layout is clean and easy to navigate, with a simple menu at the top of the page and clear sections for different types of content.

## Deployment

I deployed the website initially using Gitpod and later continued development using Visual Studio Code (VSCode). Here are the steps I followed:

**With Gitpod:**
1. Created a new repository on GitHub by logging into my GitHub account and selecting "New" repository.

2. Named the repository "vanhalen_milestone_project" and added a brief description.

3. Selected the desired options for repository visibility (public or private) and created the repository.

4. Once the repository was created, I navigated to the repository page on GitHub.

5. Clicked on the "Gitpod" button on the GitHub repository page.

6. This action automatically launched the Gitpod IDE, providing me with an online development environment preconfigured with the repository.

7. Developed and tested the website within the Gitpod workspace, using the Gitpod IDE features and tools.

8. Previewed the website by launching a local server within Gitpod.

9. Accessed the live preview of the website in the browser within the Gitpod workspace.

10. The site was fully deployed and accessible for testing and demonstration purposes within Gitpod.

**With VScode:**

1. Cloned the Git repository to a local directory using the following command:
git clone `https://github.com/myusername/vanhalen_milestone_project.git`

2. Opened the project folder in Visual Studio Code (VSCode) by selecting "Open Folder" from the File menu and choosing the appropriate directory.

3. Made any necessary changes and committed them to the Git repository using the following commands:  
Add changes:  
`git add .`  
Commit changes:  
`git commit -m "Added x feature to..."`.  
Pushed the changes to the GitHub repository:  
`git push origin main`

4. Opened any of the HTML files (e.g., index.html, tour.html, media.html, etc.) in a web browser of my choice directly from the local project directory.
